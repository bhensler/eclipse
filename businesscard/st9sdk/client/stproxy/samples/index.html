      This directory contains a number of sample web pages that illustrate how to
      incorporate Sametime functionality into your web pages. Note that to run these
      samples, it is necessary to deploy them to a server which is in the same domain
      as your Sametime 8.5 Proxy Server, in order to avoid same-source issues when
      executing JavaScript on the pages. The server can, of course, be on your local
      machine, but it must be referenced via its domain address, and not by its IP
      address or "localhost".
   </p>
   <p>
      The examples included are as follows:
      <ul>
          <li>example1.jsp</li>
          This simple example illustrates how to launch the pre-made web client from within an application.</p>
          <li>example2.jsp</li>
          Here you can see how to include LiveNames in your application using simple tags.
          <li>example3.jsp</li>
          This includes the user's BuddyList in your application.
          Note that this actually uses the complete client, but presents it as the BuddyList.
          <li>example4.jsp</li>
          This shows how to include a QuickFind component on the page, and how to add an extra
          context menu item selectively to the livenames on the QuickFind.
          <li>example5.jsp</li>
          This includes a component on the page to allow you change your presence status.
          <li>example6.jsp</li>
          This example shows how to include a user's business card information on the page.
          <li>example7.jsp</li>
          Here we embed a chat window on the page.
          <li>example8.jsp</li>
          This shows how to customise LiveNames in your application, by utilising the LiveNameModel.
          In particular, it shows how to use the base components without depending on the Dojo Toolkit.
          <li>example9.jsp</li>
          This example shows how to embed the entire web client into a web page.
          <li>example10.jsp</li>
          This example shows how to embed a contact list into a web page.
          <li>example11.jsp</li>
          This example illustrates how to create livenames without the use of the Dojo Toolkit.
          This also shows how to use the base components without depending on the Dojo Toolkit.
      </ul>
   </p>
   <p>
      Note that the samples must be updated with real values, i.e. the following values must be changed
      to allow them to work:
      <ul>
         <li>&lt;YourServer&gt;:9080</li>
         This should be set to the address and port of your proxy server; the port is usually 9080 or 9081.
         <li>&lt;YourUser&gt; and &lt;YourPassword&gt;</li>
         Change this to the username and password of a user in order to login. It's more usual to use tokens,
         so alter the <span class="code">loginByPassword</span> to <span class="code">loginByToken</span> to
         take advantage of this.
         <li>&lt;YourUser1&gt;, &lt;YourUser2&gt;, ...</li>
         Change these to other users to illustrate livenames or other functions on other users in the system
      </ul>
   </p>
