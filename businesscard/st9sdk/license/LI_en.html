software applications and systems. Licensee is solely responsible 
for the applications and systems that it develops by using this 
Program and assumes all risk and responsibility therefor.<br>
<br>
Redistributables<br>
<br>
If the Program includes components that are 
Redistributable, they will be identified in the REDIST file that accompanies 
the Program. In addition to the license rights granted in the

must conform to all directions, instruction and specifications 
in that documentation and these modifications, if any, must be 
treated as Redistributables;<br>
3) Redistributables may be distributed only as part of 
Licensee's application that was developed using the Program 
("Licensee's Application") and only to support Licensee's customers in 
connection with their use of Licensee's Application. Licensee's 
Application must constitute significant value add such that the 
Redistributables are not a substantial motivation for the acquisition by end 
users of Licensee's software product;<br>
4) If the Redistributables include a Java Runtime 
Environment, Licensee must also include other non-Java Redistributables 
with Licensee's Application, unless the Application is designed 
to run only on general computer devices (for example, laptops, 
desktops and servers) and not on handheld or other pervasive devices 
(i.e., devices that contain a microprocessor but do not have 
computing as their primary purpose);<br>
5) Licensee may not remove any copyright or notice files 
contained in the Redistributables;<br>
6) Licensee must hold IBM, its suppliers or distributors 
harmless from and against any claim arising out of the use or 
distribution of Licensee's Application;<br>
7) Licensee may not use the same path name as the original 
Redistributable files/modules;<br>

distributors names or trademarks in connection with the marketing of 
Licensee's Application without IBM's or that supplier's or 
distributor's prior written consent;<br>
9) IBM, its suppliers and distributors provide the 
Redistributables and related documentation without obligation of support and 
"AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-
INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE;<br>
10) Licensee is responsible for all technical assistance 
for Licensee's Application and any modifications to the 
Redistributables; and<br>
11) Licensee's license agreement with the end user of 
Licensee's Application must notify the end user that the 
Redistributables or their modifications may not be i) used for any purpose 
other than to enable Licensee's Application, ii) copied (except 
for backup purposes), iii) further distributed or transferred 
without Licensee's Application or iv) reverse assembled, reverse 
compiled, or otherwise translated except as specifically permitted by 
law and without the possibility of a contractual waiver. 
Furthermore, Licensee's license agreement must be at least as protective 
of IBM as the terms of this Agreement.<br>

<br>
Program-unique Terms<br>
<br>
For purposes herein, an "Application" is a computer 
program, software product or solution, developed using the Program. <br>
<br>
Licensee's Application may source presence information from 
a public instant messaging service ("Public IM Service"), 
directly or indirectly, through IBM Sametime Standard and then 
display such presence information in any other application, 
provided: (i) network-of-origin information is present at all times; 
and (ii) the network-of-origin information for any Public IM 
Service is depicted no less prominently, or otherwise less 
favorably, than network-of-origin information of any other Public IM 
Service.<br>
<br>
Certain Public IM Services may require that their network 
be accessed solely through IBM Sametime Standard or an instant 
messaging client authorized by such Public IM Service. Licensee is 
prohibited from distributing any instant messaging client that 
connects with any such Public IM Service through the IBM Sametime 
Gateway without prior certification from such Public IM Service. <br>
<br>
If Licensee's Application facilitates access to a Public IM 
Service through the IBM Sametime Gateway utilizing a wireless 
device, Licensee's Application must authorize both wireless and 
desktop access and may not be offered on a premium basis or 
otherwise be offered for an additional fee in addition to the fees 
charged for access via Licensee's non-wireless-enabled Application, 
if any.<br>
