--------------------------------
PluginRegistrationInterface  API
--------------------------------

* The PluginPresenceHandler fetch() and onFetch() methods are used to retrieve the current presence status 
of the user on the buddylist.   The initiator must subscribe to the user first in order to be notified of 
the user's presence status.  The second parameter to fetch()/onFetch(), isNewSession, indicates whether a 
new subscription session is created for the duration of the fetch operation.  The value is always false, 
as the fetch operation utilizes the subscription session active at the time of operation in order to retrieve 
the user status.


For the most up to date information please refer to the RTC Gateway Integration Guide and the Javadoc.
